# ProfileServiceLayer
ProfileServiceLayer is a small, promise-based abstraction library for ProfileService. It's used in most of my projects due to it's ease-of-use and small API. It also uses promise to let you fetch profiles before they've been loaded without error.

- Promise-based
- Supports multiple profiles
